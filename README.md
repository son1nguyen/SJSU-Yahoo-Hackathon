# SJSU-Yahoo-Hackathon

A major part of our organization is the monitoring of Yahoo systems. We have hundreds of thousands of machines that we monitor which all alert for multiple services. These alerts are scrubbed and our monitoring system correlates them in order to not bombard our Operations Center. We have provided you all with a text file of alerts and your challenge is to go through the file, clean it up if necessary, and determine how to correlate these alerts. 

On top of that, our team is working on making the systems that we support self-healing. We'd like you to propose how you would make these systems self-healing throughout our infrastructure.

Feel free to create any websites or mobile apps wherever you see the need.
The attached file (final_alert_file.csv) is an example log file from our system.

Have fun!
